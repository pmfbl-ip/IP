Port numbers below 1024 as being well known—that is, they provide standard 
services. Port 17 is known as the quote-of-the-day service. When a client 
connects to port 17 on a server, the server responds with a quote for that 
day.

Create server so it delivers a quote of the day. The quotes should be 
printable ASCII characters and should contain fewer than 512 characters, 
although multiple lines are allowed. 

Since port 17 is well known and therefore unavailable, have your server 
listen to port 6017.
