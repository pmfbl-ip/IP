Program describes a date server that uses connection-oriented TCP sockets. 

The operation allows clients to request the current date and time from
the server. The server listens to port 6013, although the port could have any
arbitrary number greater than 1024. When a connection is received, the server
returns the date and time to the client.

A client communicates with the server by creating a socket and connecting
to the port on which the server is listening. The client creates a Socket and requests
a connection with the server at IP address 127.0.0.1 on port 6013. 

The IP address 127.0.0.1 is a special IP address known as the loopback.
When a computer refers toIP address 127.0.0.1, it is referring to itself.
This mechanism allows a client and server on the same host to communicate
using the TCP/IP protocol. The IP address 127.0.0.1 could be replaced with 
the IP address of another host running the date server. 

In addition to an IP address, an actual host name, such as 
www.westminstercollege.edu, can be used as well.
